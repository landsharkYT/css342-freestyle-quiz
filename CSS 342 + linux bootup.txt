The root folder within a linux machine is “/”. 


Linux users basically goon in command line interfaces


Pwd tells you the location of files in linux.


Besides the root folder, “/” tells you if something is the root folder of another thing.


The command line specifies which directory you are currently working in.


Cd moves you around directories. 


Linux automation involves saving commands in text files and you can import text files with command.


Vim is epic.


Mkdir creates a directory.
mv is moving or modifying files
cp means copy files
rm means remove or delete


There is tab completion within linux


For rm, there is a -i which inquires you if you want to do that.


A lot of linux systems have you create your own settings file that linux asks you about which automatically enables -i mode.


-r allows you to copy and delete files recursively and they allow you to do this for directories.


DO NOT DO rm -r /*


Piping and redirection are just arrows and pipes that allows you to redirect or pipe files as different inputs and outputs.


You can kill the current process with ctrl c
Exit a text stream input: Ctrl-d
Kill a process from elsewhere: kill -9 pid


Compilers are commands in linux


G++ is one of them. You compile the program first, obtain the object file, and then you link the object file to create an executable.


Tar cvf creates “tape archives” and its a group essentially like a folder zip file.
Tar xvf extracts the tar archive.


Secure copy is basically “scp” and you have to specify the machines doing the copying. You can use this to copy to different computers.


“Scripting” is basically putting commands into a text file and then you just run the text file.


Git and Github address issues with version control


CVS is a centralized version control system where only one person can edit a file at the same time.


Forking basically means cloning the repository. 


Committing is sharing and pulling is sharing.


Include keywords in C++ yoinks the file and takes their lines of code and incorporates it within the code.


Always make your test code first before making the actual code.


Struct instance fields are public while Class are private on default.


You can directly return return {0, 1} to refer to the class/struct


You can toString in C++


 std::string to_string() const {
            return std::to_string(numerator) + "/" + std::to_string(denominator);
        }
